<!-- Welcome to our KDD' 24 Tutorial, "Towards Urban General Intelligence Through Urban Foundation Models".

Website: https://chaunceykung.github.io/temporal-causal-discovery-tutorial/ -->


## Tutorial Abstract

Machine learning techniques are now integral to the advancement of intelligent urban services, playing a crucial role in elevating the efficiency, sustainability, and livability of urban environments. The recent emergence of foundation models such as ChatGPT marks a revolutionary shift in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Their unparalleled capabilities in contextual understanding, problem solving, and adaptability across a wide range of tasks suggest that integrating these models into urban domains could have a transformative impact on the development of smart cities. 
Despite growing interest in Urban Foundation Models (UFMs), this burgeoning field faces challenges such as a lack of clear definitions, systematic reviews, and universalizable solutions.

In this tutorial, we will first introduce the concept of UFM and discuss the unique challenges involved in building them. 
We then present a data-centric taxonomy that categorizes and clarifies current UFM-related works, based on urban data modalities and types. 
Furthermore, to foster advancement in this field, we present a promising framework aimed at the prospective realization of UFMs, designed to overcome the identified challenges. 
Additionally, we explore the application landscape of UFMs, detailing their potential impact in various urban contexts.

### Tutorial Outline

### 1. Introduction [15 mins][[slides]](slides/UFM_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf)

  > We introduce the basic concepts and definitions related to Urban Foundation Models (UFMs) and how they can pave the way to Urban General Intelligence (UGI).

### 2. Challenges of Building UFMs [15 mins][[slides]](slides/UFM_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf)
  > This section discusses the challenges to building UFMs, including multi-source, multi-granularity, and multi-modal data integration; spatio-temporal reasoning capability; versatility to diverse urban task domains; and privacy and security concerns. 

### 4. Overview of UFMs [90 mins][[slides]](slides/UFM_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf)

  > We introduce a data-centric taxonomy for UFMs-related studies to shed light on the progress and efforts made in this field. Based on the urban data modalities, we categorize the existing works on UFMs into six classes: 
  > - Language-based models
  > - Vision-based models
  > - Trajectory-based models
  > - Time series-based models
  > - Multimodal models
  > - Others
  > We will clarify these studies through the lens of their focused pre-training and adaptation techniques. 

### 5. Prospects of UFMs [30 mins][[slides]](slides/UFM_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf)

  > To foster advancement in this field, we present a promising framework aimed at the prospective realization of versatile UFMs, designed to overcome the identified challenges.

### 6. Applications [30 mins][[slides]](slides/UFM_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf)

  > This section explores the application landscape of UFMs, detailing their potential impact in various urban domains, such as transportation, urban planning, energy management, environmental monitoring, and public safety and security.
